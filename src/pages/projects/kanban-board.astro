    This website was coded based on the designs from <a

      >Frontend Mentor</a
    >. Frontend Mentor is a platform where users are given designs and the goal
    is to turn that design into a functioning website. This challenge is of the
    guru level. Although still not finished it's somewhat functional.

  <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold">Tech Stack and Challenges</h2>
  <p class="mt-8">
    Selecting the stack for this project has been tricky. Originally I picked
    NextJS. I thought it would be a good idea to create this project full stack
    from the beginning and I already had used NextJS. Mid project I realized
    that I needed to learn more about databases and backend. At that point I was
    more interested in practicing more with React so I decided to just use local
    storage. Using local storage with NextJS quickly becomes a mess of hydration
    errors. At that point I decided to just use React and Vite to get more
    practice building React apps. Further ahead I added React Router to the
    stack, which brought some additional challenges.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold">Lessons Learned</h2>

  <p class="mb-16 mt-8">
    The most important lesson that I have learned doing this challenge is that
    no matter what stack you pick you're gonna face many difficulties. If I went
    back I would just keep on with my initial idea of using NextJS and learn
    more about back and development.
