        I first started programming when I was in university. I started learning
        C++ and found it very enjoyable. I even made my final degree project
        using C++.

        It wasn't until years later that I did my first incursion in web
        development. It was around 2008. I had created a small community of
        photography enthusiast and I made a website composed of a blog and a
        forum to share our pictures and experiences. I remember that I used
        Joomla and that in order to create rounded corners you had to use
        background images. Fun times!

        More recently I decided to focus my efforts on becoming a software
        developer. It was something that I missed and that I was passionate
        about. My first big project was a browser extension. I had started using
        voice to control my computer and one thing that I found lacking was the
        ability to easily control the browser by voice. The solutions up to that
        point were unsatisfying to me. So I set myself to create something
        better. It took me hundreds of hours and had to overcome many challenges
        but I am very happy with the result. Rango, the extension to control
        your browser by voice is used by me and a several hundred other people
        everyday.

        When I'm not coding I enjoy taking walks to the beach, walking my cats
        (Yes, with a leash!) and eating pizza.
