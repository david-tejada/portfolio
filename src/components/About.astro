  <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
    I first started programming when I was in university. I started learning C++
    and found it very enjoyable. I even made my final degree project using C++.

    It wasn't until years later that I did my first incursion in web
    development. It was around 2008. I had created a small community of
    photography enthusiast and I made a website composed of a blog and a forum
    to share our pictures and experiences. I remember that I used Joomla and
    that in order to create rounded corners you had to use background images.
    Fun times!

    More recently I decided to focus my efforts on becoming a software
    developer. It was something that I missed and that I was passionate about.
    My first big project was a browser extension. I had started using voice to
    control my computer and one thing that I found lacking was the ability to
    easily control the browser by voice. The solutions up to that point were
    unsatisfying to me. So I set myself to create something better. It took me
    hundreds of hours and had to overcome many challenges but I am very happy
    with the result. Rango, the extension to control your browser by voice is
    used by me and a several hundred other people everyday.

    When I'm not coding I enjoy taking walks to the beach, walking my cats (Yes,
    with a leash!) and eating pizza.
